**Included machine learning model is ready to predict whether the cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign.**

## ABOUT THE DATASET
The dataset was downloaded from ***sklearn*** , you can have a look at the dataset [**here.**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

**Dataset includes:**
- Classes : 2

- Samples per class : 212(M),357(B)

- Samples total : 569

- Dimensionality : 30

- Features : real, positive

**ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION** : 

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a)  radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b)  texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c)  perimeter

d)  area

e)  smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f)  compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g)  concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h)  concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i)  symmetry


j)  fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USED
Support Vector Machine

***HIGHEST AUC*** = 97%


## PRE-REQUISTIES
- Basic Python
- Basic understanding of anaconda and jupyter notebook.
